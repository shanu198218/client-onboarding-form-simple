# client-onboarding-form-simple

A simple client onboarding form built with **Next.js**, **React Hook Form (RHF)**, and **Zod** for schema validation.  
It demonstrates form validation, accessibility basics, clean component structure, error and success handling, and the use of an environment variable for the external API endpoint.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **React Hook Form** for state management and submission handling.
- **Zod** for validation and clear error messages.
- **Environment-based API endpoint** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ONBOARD_URL`).
- **Pre-fill service selection** via URL query parameters.
- **Accessible form markup** with proper labels, error messages, and keyboard navigation.
- **Inline success/error alerts** after submission.
- **Unit test for Zod schema for using jest**.

## ðŸ›  Setup Steps
- git clone https://github.com/shanu198218/client-onboarding-form-simple.

- cd client-onboarding-form-simple.

- npm install

- create .env file and declare the variable **NEXT_PUBLIC_ONBOARD_URL** then add you actual external API endpoint. i used **httpbin.org** service to this demo project.

- npm run dev
- open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

ðŸ“‹ How RHF + Zod Are Wired

- In OnboardingForm.tsx, the form is initialized with useForm from React Hook Form and a zodResolver that wraps the form.schema.ts file. This links Zodâ€™s validation rules directly to the form. All inputs are registered with RHFâ€™s register method, so when handleSubmit runs, Zod validates the data first. If validation passes, submitOnboardingForm is called; if it fails, RHF automatically fills formState.errors for showing error messages.

<input type="text" {...register("fullName")} /> : RHF register input

Assumptions

- Since a working API endpoint wasnâ€™t given, a public test API (https://httpbin.org/) service post request was  used for submission verification.
- Added a "Demo" button for testing purposes, which auto-fills sample form data (e.g., full name, email, company, selected service). This is for demonstration only and would not be present in production.
- Date Handling: The Default project start date is pre-filled with todayâ€™s date.
